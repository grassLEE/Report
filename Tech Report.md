**POE:**  
1. This section is written is a numbered list (or ordered list).
    - However, these OLs can and should include supportng bullets (or unordered list) points.
    - Like these bullets *here*
2. When utilizing an acronym, such as the above "OLs" example, always first write out the full phrase and then cite the letters.
    - Remember, to surround the citation letters in parens and quotes, such as ordered lists ("OLs").
    - The following usage of the acronym can then be used throughout the rest of the report.
3. The POE section needs to be drafted as a linear narrative with a naturally starting point and sequential step-by-step descriptions.
    - This means maintaining an active voice, where the development or engineering team undergoes the iterative process of resolving the identified technical challenges.
